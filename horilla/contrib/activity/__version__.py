__1_11_8__ = _(
    "Fix TaskCreateForm refresh targeting #TaskTab so new tasks appear without a full "
    "reload; enable table_auto on activity tab list views so sticky Actions columns are "
    "not clipped. Meeting create: harden invite permissions, timezones, and Meet link "
    "handling. Clear email suggestions on blur for activity and meeting forms."
)

__1_11_7__ = _(
    "Registered Activity for export_data. Improved activity tab hover styles and replaced "
    "fixed viewport list widths with flex-based layout."

__1_11_6__ = _(
    "Optional Calls integration without a hard dependency: calls_enabled and "
    "get_phone_number template tags gate Call Now in the activity tab when the Calls "
    "app is installed. CallListView excludes telephony-purpose logs from the manual "
    "call history list. Activity create form excludes call_duration_display."
)

__1_11_5__ = _(
    "Simplified mail visibility so can_send_mail and can_view_mail follow parent-record "
    "change and view access. Activity tab Edit/Delete actions and email Send/Cancel/Snooze "

__1_11_3__ = _(
    "Disabled base owner_filtration on EmailListView. Centralised get_main_url in the "
    "list-view mixin and fixed tab-calls typo in status update and activity tab template. "
    "Task and activity creates now navigate directly to the correct tab instead of "
    "reverting to the first tab after reload; aligned task-create reload trigger with "
    "project-wide jQuery convention. Fixed delete and bulk-action views that reverted "
    "to the wrong tab."
)

__1_11_2__ = _(
    "Fixed call duration field ordering and removed redundant validation; history tab now "
    "correctly identifies CallLog entries and displays call status. Use load_branding() TITLE "
    "as the fallback company name in meeting invitation emails. Allow ActivityView for users "
    "with view_own_activity as well as view_activity. Added meeting provider choices (Zoom, "
    "Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) on the Activity model."
)

__1_11_1__ = _(
    "Email-tab permissions corrected to add/view/change/delete own-record checks. "
    "Removed redundant fields attributes from create-view forms superseded by form_class. "
    "Adopted the utils.timezone shim, standardized first-party imports, and added "
    "class and method docstrings for pylint compliance."

__1_10_0__ = _(
    "Release 1.10: activity ships under contrib with app label activity. "
    "AppLauncher, imports, namespaces, registrations, templates, and metadata "
    "references updated from the legacy activity package name to the contrib layout."
)

__1_2_1__ = _(
    "Reduced redundant history entries, improved Many-to-Many field representation, "
    "and added cleaner labels for mail events and activity creation with "
    "new template filters for better rendering."
)

__1_2_0__ = _(
    "Improved activity workflow behavior. The Pending tab now shows all incomplete activities"
    "regardless of status label, and activity type configuration handling was enhanced "
    "for improved workflow accuracy."
)


__1_1_0__ = _(
    "Migrated from AppConfig to AppLauncher and replaced utilities with"
    "utils.decorators, utils.translation, and shortcuts where applicable."
)
